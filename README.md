# The Neon Network -- E-coupon blockchain research project
This a HKUST university research project supervised by prof. HUI Pan and Dimitris.<br>
This repository is created as a minimized version (excluding the unit tests, etc.) from the original repository [here](https://github.com/yhuag/Ethereum-HyperIntelligent-Contract-Research). <br>
See smart contract sorce code deployed on [rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x3a4b4259140988baaf9de41e95423052d9c0300e#code)

## Description 
The Neon Network scaffolds a sustainable and scalable e-coupon market framework upon Ethereum network, facilitating secure value distribution gateways and non-falsifiability for e-coupons within the sophisticated networks of issuers and users. This paper presents a com- plete and generic solution to the emerging market needs of e-coupon on the blockchain, which entailed less manual costs and errors through providing non-falsifiable and non-repudiable coupon instances with the smart contract.
